							conditions in the Master Agreement.**

								**LICENSE: Ivory Guide, in consideration of the subscription fee paid to Ivory Guide, or free access granted through the registration
								process, and your acceptance of this Agreement, grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license and right to use and access the
								Licensed Content in accordance with the applicable subscription terms (as may be further provided in Ivory Guide&rsquo;s separate
								invoice terms or any additional subscription and license terms, including, but not limited to, the Master Agreement, entered into by
								and between Ivory Guide and you and/or the Institution):
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<ol>
							<li>
								<span>
									INDIVIDUAL: An individual subscription permits one individual to access and use the Licensed Content for his or her own use only by
									loading the software on a single computer (i.e., within a single CPU) at a fixed location, by loading the PDA software on a single
									Personal Digital Assistant (&ldquo;PDA&rdquo;), by loading or accessing the Licensed Content on or from a mobile device (e.g., a
									tablet or smartphone) (a &ldquo;Mobile Device&rdquo;), or by using his or her unique user name and password to access the Licensed
									Content from any location via the Internet.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>

						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								PERMITTED USES: You may occasionally print out individual articles for personal clinical, educational, or research use and/or email
								individual articles, reports, or results to a colleague, provided that the articles printed and emailed by an individual Authorized
								User contain in aggregate only insubstantial portions of the Licensed Content and include a source reference to Ivory Guide and its
								copyright notice. Under no circumstances may Authorized Users print or email large numbers of articles from the Licensed Content.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								PROHIBITED USES: Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, any copying, printing, distributing, or modifying of the Licensed
								Content is strictly prohibited. No part of the Licensed Content may be copied for resale or other commercial use, or posted on public
								bulletin boards, websites, Internet domains, or online chatrooms, or hyperlinked, indexed, or otherwise utilized by automated software
								means, including search engines, robots, spiders, crawlers, data mining tools, or any other software that aggregates access to, or the
								content of, the Licensed Content. The Licensed Content may not be combined with other content in knowledge banks or through similar
								technologies. No part of the Licensed Content may be reverse engineered or included in other software. Ivory Guide electronically
								monitors compliance with this Agreement (or may otherwise audit your use of the Licensed Content for compliance with these terms) and
								reserves the right in its sole discretion to change and/or cancel an individual&rsquo;s username and password or to disable an IP
								address without notice in the event of multiple concurrent logins, excessive search quantities, or excessive download traffic volumes.
								You agree to comply with all applicable laws, including all US export laws and regulations, in connection with your access and use of
								the Licensed Content.

						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								SUBSCRIPTION TERM: You have obtained the right to use and access the Licensed Content for the subscription period for which you or
								your Institution have agreed to our terms. At the end of this period, your license and your associated rights, such as technical
								support, will expire automatically, unless you or your Institution have renewed your subscription on Ivory Guide&rsquo;s then-current
								terms. Ivory Guide may embed technology in the Licensed Content causing it to become inaccessible after your subscription period. The
								Agreement and your license to use the Licensed Content will also terminate if you fail to comply with any term or condition in this
								Agreement.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								RESTRICTION AGAINST TRANSFER: You may not sublicense, assign, share, sell, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer your right to use the
								Licensed Content (including your username and password) whether by merger, operation of law, or otherwise.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								USE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT: The editors and authors of the Licensed Content have conscientiously and carefully tried to create the
								identified diagnosis measures, and treatment alternatives, and drug dosages in the Licensed Content that conform to the standards of
								professional practice that prevailed at the time of publication. However, standards and practices in medicine change as new data
								become available, and the individual user and medical professional should consult a variety of sources. For this reason, only the most
								current release of the Licensed Content should be consulted when information is sought. New updates of the Licensed Content are issued
								periodically; do not rely on older versions. In addition, when prescribing medications, the user is advised to check the product
								information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in dosage schedule or contraindications,
								particularly if the agent to be administered is new, infrequently used, or has a narrow therapeutic range. The Licensed Content
								describes basic principles of diagnosis and therapy. The information provided in the Licensed Content is no substitute for individual
								patient assessment based upon the healthcare provider&rsquo;s examination of each patient and consideration of laboratory data and
								other factors unique to the patient. The Licensed Content should be used as a tool to help the user reach diagnostic and treatment
								decisions, bearing in mind that individual and unique circumstances may lead the user to reach decisions not presented in the Licensed
								Content. The opinions expressed in the Licensed Content are those of its authors and editors and may or may not represent the official
								position of any medical societies cooperating with, endorsing, or recommending the Licensed Content.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								LIMITED RIGHTS NOTICE: Any access to the Licensed Content provided under contract to the U.S. Government is provided with limited
								rights. The Licensed Content consist of data, as defined in 48 CFR 27.401 or 48 CFR 27.404-2(a), as applicable, and restricted
								computer software as defined in 48 CFR 27.401. The Licensed Content may be reproduced and used by the U.S. Government, provided that
								they will not be used for or in connection with manufacturing and will not be disclosed outside of the U.S. Government or to any U.S.
								Government contractor, without the prior express written permission of Ivory Guide.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								DATA PROTECTION: To the extent that Ivory Guide Processes Personal Data of Data (as such terms are defined in the Data Protection
								Annex) located in the European Economic Area and/or United Kingdom in performing its obligations under this Agreement, the terms
								displayed at [
							</span>
							<a href="https://www.ivoryguide.com/privacy-policy">
								<span>https://www.ivoryguide.com/privacy-policy</span>
							</a>
							<span>
								] applies to such Processing and is incorporated into, and made part of, this Agreement. Ivory Guide may, in its sole discretion,
								amend or replace the Data Protection Annex at any time without notice to you, and you should review the terms of the latest Data
								Protection Annex that applies to this Agreement at regular intervals.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								Limited Warranty: If Ivory Guide has supplied physical media to you containing the licensed content and they are defective, such media
								will be replaced without charge if returned to the place of purchase. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, the licensed
								content provided under this agreement are furnished by Ivory Guide &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and without any warranty or condition
								whatsoever. Ivory Guide disclaims any warranty that the licensed content will be uninterrupted or error-free. Ivory Guide, its
								affiliates, and licensors make no representations, warranties, or conditions with respect to the licensed content hereunder, and Ivory
								Guide, its affiliates, and licensors disclaim all representations, warranties, and conditions of any kind or nature, expressed or
								implied, arising out of or related to this agreement, the licensed content, or results derived therefrom, including but not limited to
								any warranties or conditions regarding accuracy, quality, correctness, completeness, comprehensiveness, suitability, system
								availability, compatibility, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, infringement, or otherwise (irrespective of any
								course of performance, or use of trade). Any statements or representations made by any other person or entity are void. You assume all
								risk as to the quality, function, performance, and accuracy of the licensed content.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								Limitation of Liability: Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, in no event will Ivory Guide, its affiliates, its
								licensors, any of its respective directors, officers, employees, or agents, or any other party involved in the creation, production,
								promotion, or marketing of the licensed content be liable to you or any other party whose claim is related to this Agreement, under
								any theory of tort, contract, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory: for (i) lost profits, lost revenues, lost business
								opportunities or exemplary, punitive, special, indirect, incidental, reliance, exemplary, consequential, or similar damages, each of
								which is hereby excluded by agreement of the parties, regardless of whether the applicable entity has been advised of the possibility
								of such damages, or (ii) for any claims, damages, or costs of any nature in excess of the license fees paid by you to Ivory Guide
								during the twelve (12) months preceding the earliest event giving rise to such liability. This limitation of liability and the
								disclaimers set forth in section 10 are independent of any remedies set forth herein and will survive and apply even if such remedies
								are found to have failed of their essential purpose. Each party acknowledges that this limitation of liability is a material part of
								the consideration provided by the other party in exchange for the rights granted under this Agreement.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts and some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
								limitation of certain types of loss, fines, costs, expenses, or special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages, so
								the above limitation and exclusion may not apply to you.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							<span>
								PRIVACY: You acknowledge and agree that the Clinical Effectiveness Privacy &amp; Cookie Notice, available at
								[https://www.ivoryguide.com/privacy-policy], applies to your use of the Licensed Content. This Clinical Effectiveness Privacy &amp;
								Cookie Notice is designed to inform you about the types of information that Ivory Guide may collect from and/or about you when you use
								the Licensed Content, including such tools that may record interactions with Ivory Guide and/or the Licensed Content, including, but
								not limited to, clicks, mouse movements, hovers and scrolling, keystrokes in non-excluded fields, IP address, location, and similar
								metadata.
							</span>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>

								GENERAL: If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, it shall be deemed
								omitted and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may be modified only in writing
								authorized by Ivory Guide. Ivory Guide&rsquo;s waiver of any right shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right in the
								future. This Agreement, and any disputes arising out of or related hereto, shall be governed by and enforced in accordance with the
								laws of the state of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without regard to any law or statutory provision which would
								require or permit the application of another jurisdiction&rsquo;s substantive law. Each party agrees that it will bring any action or
								proceeding in connection with this Agreement exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and that it irrevocably
								submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding and waives all objections to jurisdiction and
								venue of such courts. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not
								apply to this Agreement. Each party knowingly, voluntarily, and unconditionally waives its right to jury trial for any dispute in
								connection with this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject
								matter hereof, and all prior agreements, representations, statements, and undertakings, oral or written, are hereby expressly
								superseded and canceled. In addition to any other provision of this Agreement that by its terms survives expiration or termination of
								this Agreement, Sections 2, 4, and 7-13 survive in full force and effect following expiration or termination of this Agreement.
