              restrict or stop the processing of your personal information held
              by us for a certain period of time, or for an indefinite period.
              In certain circumstances, it may not be possible for us to accept
              your request; for example, when the processing is necessary to
              comply with a legal obligation, or if we can demonstrate
              compelling legitimate grounds otherwise.

              Right to object: the right to object to the processing of your
              personal information. The reasons for an objection should relate
              to your particular situation, and be related to processing based
              on the legitimate interest condition. We will then no longer
              process the personal information, unless we can demonstrate
              compelling reasons otherwise. In certain circumstances, you have
              the unconditional right to object; for instance, in the context of
              direct marketing activities.

              you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
              Withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the
              processing of your personal data prior to the withdrawal.
