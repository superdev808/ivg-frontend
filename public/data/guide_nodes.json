Change the lens direction by rolling the sleeve or flipping the camera over.\n2. Viewing during scanning: As a beginner, it's more natural to look in the mouth while scanning. However, as you gain experience, you may prefer looking at the screen, especially for capturing missing data.\n3. Scanning enough: The goal is to capture all critical areas with minimal duplication. Overscanning slows down processes and increases file size. Avoid rescanning areas already captured.\n4. Managing scan data: Take a simple framework scan and then stop. Zoom in to identify holes in critical areas and fill those in. Holes in non-critical areas are acceptable.",

Change the lens direction by rolling the sleeve or flipping the camera over.\n2. Viewing during scanning: As a beginner, it's more natural to look in the mouth while scanning. However, as you gain experience, you may prefer looking at the screen, especially for capturing missing data.\n3. Scanning enough: The goal is to capture all critical areas with minimal duplication. Overscanning slows down processes and increases file size. Avoid rescanning areas already captured.\n4. Managing scan data: Take a simple framework scan and then stop. Zoom in to identify holes in critical areas and fill those in. Holes in non-critical areas are acceptable.",

Change the lens direction by rolling the sleeve or flipping the camera over.\n2. Viewing during scanning: As a beginner, it's more natural to look in the mouth while scanning. However, as you gain experience, you may prefer looking at the screen, especially for capturing missing data.\n3. Scanning enough: The goal is to capture all critical areas with minimal duplication. Overscanning slows down processes and increases file size. Avoid rescanning areas already captured.\n4. Managing scan data: Take a simple framework scan and then stop. Zoom in to identify holes in critical areas and fill those in. Holes in non-critical areas are acceptable.\u20285. Quadrant or full-arch scan: Decide if you need a quadrant (to the midline) for single restorations or a full-arch scan for bridges, clear aligners, splints, and digital denture preliminary scans.",

Change the lens direction by rolling the sleeve or flipping the camera over.\n2. Viewing during scanning: As a beginner, it's more natural to look in the mouth while scanning. However, as you gain experience, you may prefer looking at the screen, especially for capturing missing data.\n3. Scanning enough: The goal is to capture all critical areas with minimal duplication. Overscanning slows down processes and increases file size. Avoid rescanning areas already captured.\n4. Managing scan data: Take a simple framework scan and then stop. Zoom in to identify holes in critical areas and fill those in. Holes in non-critical areas are acceptable.\u20285. Quadrant or full-arch scan: Decide if you need a quadrant (to the midline) for single restorations or a full-arch scan for bridges, clear aligners, splints, and digital denture preliminary scans.",

Change the lens direction by rolling the sleeve or flipping the camera over.\n2. Viewing during scanning: As a beginner, it's more natural to look in the mouth while scanning. However, as you gain experience, you may prefer looking at the screen, especially for capturing missing data.\n3. Scanning enough: The goal is to capture all critical areas with minimal duplication. Overscanning slows down processes and increases file size. Avoid rescanning areas already captured.\n4. Managing scan data: Take a simple framework scan and then stop. Zoom in to identify holes in critical areas and fill those in. Holes in non-critical areas are acceptable.\u20285. Quadrant or full-arch scan: Decide if you need a quadrant (to the midline) for single restorations or a full-arch scan for bridges, clear aligners, splints, and digital denture preliminary scans.",
